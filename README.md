Data visualization of the top ten most frequent cocktail ingredients, according to data from the [Mr. Boston Bartender's Guide](https://mrbostondrinks.com/)

Data downloaded from:
https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-05-26

The base plot was created in ggplot, with small graphics (the lime and straw icons) created in Adobe Illustrator.

Cocktail.R contains all code used to analyze the data and create the base plot. CocktailPlot.png is the final image with added graphics. cocktailplot.pdf is the export of the plot from RStudio that I then brought into Figma to add graphics to.
